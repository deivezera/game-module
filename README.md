# Overview

This project is a 2D endless runner game developed using the Godot Engine. The player controls a ninja character who automatically runs and must jump over incoming obstacles to survive. The game features an infinite loop where the speed increases as the player progresses, making it more challenging over time. It includes a scoring system based on survival time and tracks the player's high score.
